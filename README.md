# Elevator Project by XATM
## Iteration One 
### Things we decided that we need
* IR sensor to detect distance
* At least two Blutooth modules to send data from the BBG mounted on elevator 
* Bluetooth signal receivers (potentially phones?)
* 2 BBG boards with one acting as the sensing module and the other as a local server that connects to the internet and communicates with the central server
